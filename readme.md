# Advent of Code

A repository to store all my Advent of Codes.

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar.

To run solutions use the `run.py` script with the following arguments:
```
-y/--year : the year to run
-d/--day : the day to run
-e/--example : (optional) use example input rather than main input
```
